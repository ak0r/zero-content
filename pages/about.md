**I'm Amit** — I work in technology and travel whenever I can manage it.

During the week, I'm building and maintaining systems for a living. Currently working on workflow automation platforms, dealing with data pipelines, and making sure production environments stay stable. It's the kind of work where you solve interesting problems on good days and put out fires on bad ones.

Outside of work, I try to travel. Not constantly, but regularly enough to have accumulated some stories and photos. I prefer cities over resorts, nature over parties, public transport over rental cars, and getting lost in neighbourhoods over following guidebooks.

## From the Terminals

I work as a Solution Architect by day, but I create my own things during off-hours. The technical content on this blog comes from the experiments I do — solutions to problems I've faced, tools I've found useful, and occasional rants about things that don't work the way they should.

## To the Trails

I'm not a full-time traveller or content creator. Just someone who likes exploring new places when time and budget allow. My travel style is straightforward: pick a destination, do some minimal planning, spend most of the time walking around, and take photos along the way.

The galleries here are collections from these trips. No expensive equipment, no perfect lighting — just photos taken with my phone or my Nikon camera, capturing whatever caught my eye at the moment.

## This Site

I built this as a personal archive more than anything else. A place to document both the technical work and the travel experiences. No ads, no newsletter signups, no "growth hacking" — just writing when I have something to say.

If the technical posts help someone debug a similar issue, great. If the travel photos inspire someone's next trip, even better. If you're just browsing, that's fine too.
