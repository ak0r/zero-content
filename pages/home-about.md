**Hey, I'm Amit** — Solution Architect by day, and traveller whenever possible. This site is where I document both sides — the technical experiments I do during off-hours and the places I explore when I'm away from the screen. Sometimes I'm deep in code, other times I'm lost in a new city. Both make for good stories.
