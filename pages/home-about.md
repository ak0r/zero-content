## Hey I am Amit.

I build **systems** during the week and explore **streets** around the world whenever I can. Both worlds make for good **stories**. This blog documents them both — the technical experiments I run in my off-hours and the places I discover when I'm away from the screen. Sometimes I'm debugging code, other times I'm lost in a new city.

That's me in 10 seconds. Want the extended version? Head over to [/about](/about).
