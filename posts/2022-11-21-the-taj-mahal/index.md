India is a home of many wonders natural and man-made, and one of the most iconic and awe-inspiring landmarks in the country is the Taj Mahal. This beautiful mausoleum is a symbol of love and devotion, and it's a must-see destination for anyone visiting India.

The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It is said that after her death, Shah Jahan was so grief-stricken that he vowed to build the most beautiful tomb in the world to honour her memory. He enlisted the help of some of the most skilled artisans and architects of the time, and the result was the breath-taking Taj Mahal we know today.

The first thing that strikes you when you approach the Taj Mahal is its sheer size. The white marble structure is massive and imposing, and its beauty is difficult to ignore. As you get closer, you'll start to notice the intricate details and decorations that cover the walls and domes. The structure is adorned with stunning inlaid floral patterns, calligraphy, and geometric designs.

When you first enter the Taj Mahal, you will be greeted by a large courtyard leading to the main building. Inside, the tombs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal can be found in a small chamber in the centre of the building. The tombs are surrounded by intricate carvings and inlaid marble, and they are a testament to the builders' skill and artistry.

One of the most impressive aspects of the Taj Mahal is its symmetry. The structure is perfectly balanced, and the symmetry is enhanced by the use of reflecting pools in front of the main structure. These pools reflect the image of the Taj Mahal, creating a mirror image that is truly breath-taking.

The Taj Mahal is open daily except Friday, and it's best to go early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid crowds. However, regardless of when you visit, keep in mind that the Taj Mahal is a popular tourist destination, so expect long lines and crowds.

To summarise, the Taj Mahal is a must-see attraction for anyone visiting India. It's a timeless masterpiece that represents love and devotion, and it's truly a world wonder. Whether you're an architecture enthusiast or simply want to see one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, the Taj Mahal is a must-see.
